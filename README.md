## Context & Data

The FLAIR #1 dataset is sampled countrywide and is composed of over 20 billion annotated pixels, acquired over three years and different months (spatio-temporal domains). The dataset is available to download <a href="https://ignf.github.io/FLAIR/">here.</a> It consists of 512 x 512 patches with 13 (baselines) or 19 (full) semantic classes (see associated datapaper). Each patch has 5 channels (RVB-Infrared-Elevation).

## Baseline model 

A U-Net architecture with a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder from the pytorch segmentation models library is used for the baselines. The used architecture allows integration of patch-wise metadata information and employs commonly used image data augmentation techniques. It has about 24.4M parameters and it is implemented using the _segmentation-models-pytorch_ library. The results are evaluated with an Intersection Over Union (IoU) metric and a single mIoU is reported (see associated datapaper).

The _metadata_ strategy refers encoding metadata with a shallow MLP and concatenate this encoded information to the U-Net encoder output. The _augmentation_ strategy employs three typical geometrical augmentations (see associated datapaper).

## Lib usage 

<br><br>

### Installation :pushpin:

```bash
# it's recommended to install on a conda virtual env
conda create -n FLAIR-1 -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate FLAIR-1
git clone https@github.com:IGNF/FLAIR-1.git
cd FLAIR-1*
pip install -e .
# if torch.cuda.is_available() returns False, do the following :
# pip install torch>=2.0.0 --extra-index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

```

<br><br>

### Tasks :mag_right:

This library comprises two main entry points:<br>

#### :file_folder: flair_inc

The flair module is used for training, inference and metrics calculation at the patch level. To use this pipeline :

```bash
flair --conf=/my/conf/file.yaml
```
This will perform the tasks specified in the configuration file. If ‘train’ is enabled, it will train the model and save the trained model to the output folder. If ‘predict’ is enabled, it will load the trained model (or a specified checkpoint if ‘train’ is not enabled) and perform prediction on the test data. If ‘metrics’ is enabled, it will calculate the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and other IoU metrics for the predicted and ground truth masks.
A toy dataset (reduced size) is available to check that your installation and the information in the configuration file are correct.
Note: A notebook is available in the legacy-torch branch (which uses different libraries versions and structure) that was used during the challenge.

#### :file_folder: zone_detect
This module aims to infer a pre-trained model at a larger scale than individual patches. It allows overlapping inferences using a margin argument. Specifically, this module expects a single georeferenced TIFF file as input.

```bash
flair-detect --conf=/my/conf/file-detect.yaml
```

<br><br>

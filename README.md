## Context & Data

The FLAIR #1 dataset is sampled countrywide and is composed of over 20 billion annotated pixels, acquired over three years and different months (spatio-temporal domains). The dataset is available to download <a href="https://ignf.github.io/FLAIR/">here.</a> It consists of 512 x 512 patches with 13 (baselines) or 19 (full) semantic classes (see associated datapaper). Each patch has 5 channels (RVB-Infrared-Elevation).

## Baseline model 

A U-Net architecture with a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder from the pytorch segmentation models library is used for the baselines. The used architecture allows integration of patch-wise metadata information and employs commonly used image data augmentation techniques. It has about 24.4M parameters and it is implemented using the _segmentation-models-pytorch_ library. The results are evaluated with an Intersection Over Union (IoU) metric and a single mIoU is reported (see associated datapaper).

The _metadata_ strategy refers encoding metadata with a shallow MLP and concatenate this encoded information to the U-Net encoder output. The _augmentation_ strategy employs three typical geometrical augmentations (see associated datapaper).

domain, obtained with the baseline trained model:

### Input CSV files

The input CSV files for training, validation, and testing are provided in a folder with the official split. Each CSV file should contain the paths to the image-mask pairs for the corresponding dataset.

### Usage

To use the pipeline, run the main script with the configuration file as an argument:


```
python main.py --config_file=./flair-1-config.yml
```

To run the pipeline if you have install flair with pip:

```bash
flair-train --conf-file=/my/conf/file.yaml
```

The script will perform the tasks specified in the configuration file. If ‘train’ is enabled, it will train the model and save the trained model to the output folder. If ‘predict’ is enabled, it will load the trained model (or a specified checkpoint if ‘train’ is not enabled) and perform prediction on the test data. If ‘metrics’ is enabled, it will calculate the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and other IoU metrics for the predicted and ground truth masks.

A toy dataset (reduced size) is available to check that your installation and the information in the configuration file are correct.

<em>Note: </em> A notebook is available in the legacy-torch branch (which uses different libraries versions and structure) that was used during the challenge.

## Detection
<br>
The command line detection aims to bring detection at scale, meaning you can use it for any size of raster or vrt, could be a country.
The detection uses overlaping<br>
To run detection:

```bash
flair-detect --conf=/my/conf/file.yaml
```

You can find cofiguration exemple files (we use yaml) with gpu: [gpu configuration](detect_conf_example_gpu.yaml) <br>
or with cpu: [cpu configuration](detect_conf_example_cpu.yaml)

`img_size_pixel`: (Optional), integer,  size of the image in extracted patches in pixel, default is 512 <br><br>
`checkpoint`: (Mandatory), str, path to your checkpoint<br><br>
`n_classes`: (Mandatory), integer, number of classes<br><br>
`batch_size`: (Optional), integer, size of batch in dataloader, default is 2<br><br>
`key_path`: (Optional), list of string,   Used only if your checkpoint was not made with the training loop of flair. If you want to extract the state_dict field from a checkpoint coming from another pytorch lightning module than the Flair one. Expecting a list, like this ['state_dict']. Default is null (None)<br><br>
`model_prefix`: (Optional), string,  Used only if your checkpoint was not made with the training loop of flair. Like key_path, used to extract the named module in pytorch segmentation models format (something like 'seg_model.model') if your state_dict named module start like this, it will delete from every named module this part of the name and will keep only the pytorch segmenation models ones (starting by encoder.* or decoder.*). Default is null (None)<br><br>
`use_gpu`: (Optional), boolean, rather use gpu or cpu for inference, default is true<br><br>
`output_path`: (Mandatory), string, path where you want to output your result<br><br>
`model_name`: (Optional), string, Used only if your checkpoint was not made with the training loop of flair. Name of the model in pytorch segmentation models, default is 'unet'<br><br>
`encoder_name`: (Optional), string, Used only if your checkpoint was not made with the training loop of flair. Name of the encoder from pytorch segmentation model, default is 'resnet34'<br><br>
`output_type`: (Optional) type of output, can be "float32" for raw model output, "uint8" for a band of integer between 0 and 255 representing the output of the model (use less memory than float32), "argmax" which will output only one band with the index of the class, and "bit" which will binarize the output of each band with a threshold<br><br>
`num_worker`: (Optional) number of worker used by dataloader, in macosx, value should be set to 0 and on other systems vlaue should not be set at a higher value than 2 for linux because paved detection can have concurrency issues compared with traditional detection and set to 0 for mac and windows (gdal implementation's problem)<br><br>
`zone`: (Mandatory), this is where you configure your layers (rasters of vrt of rasters) inputs. You can have one or many layers<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;`margin`: (Optional), integer, used to compute the margin between patchs for overlapping detection. 256 by exemple means that every 256Xresolution step, a patch center will be computed. Overlaping detection aims at using an efficient receptive field at any point in your input zone.<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;`layers`: (Mandatory), you could have one layer of a list of layers representing your raster of vrt input, and even select the bands of interest<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- `path`: (Mandatory), string,  path to your raster or vrt layer<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;- `bands`: (Optional), list of integer from 1 to ... (something like [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], order doesn't count), used to extract only the bands of interest for detection, default is null, and it will use all your bands.<br>
